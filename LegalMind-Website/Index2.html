Legislation referred to:

2. Customs and Excise Act, Chapter 233 of the Laws of Zambia

3. Value Added Tax Act General (Amendment) Rules, 2018

1.0 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND FACTS

1.1 In its legal bearing, this appeal is in truth about the extent to
which a tax payer's defectum ad producendum oported
documentis (failure to produce appropriate documents) will
justify the tax authorities’ rejection to grant tax credit to the
tax payer.

1.2 It impeaches a ruling of the Tax Appeals Tribunal (the
Tribunal) given on 23rd September, 2020 whose effect was to
reverse the decision of the Commissioner General of the
appellant, disallowing certain Value Added Tax (VAT) refunds
3
claimed by the respondent on certain imports made by the
latter. The Tribunal ordered the appellant to pay the VAT
withheld with interest.

1.3 The respondent tax payer is an incorporated entity which is
also registered under the provision of the Value Added Tax Act,
Chapter 331 of the Laws of Zambia. By virtue of such
registration, the respondent is entitled to claim credit to it on
VAT paid on goods such as raw materials imported by it.

1.4 In point of fact, the respondent had imported into Zambia
certain goods under Bills of Entry designated as Nos. C21263,
C21274 and C21279 and paid VAT on those bills in the sums
of K38,843.00, K90,384.00 and K1,788.00, respectively.

1.5 It then claimed VAT refunds on the said Bills of Entry in May,
2018. This was, however, disallowed by the appellant under
circumstances more fully explained in the paragraphs
following.

1.6 From the 4th to the 12th October, 2018, an audit was
undertaken on the respondent by the appellant’s Domestic
Taxes Division to ascertain the validity of the VAT refund
14
claims by the respondent for the period November, 2017 to
May, 2018.

1.7 In a letter dated 15th October, 2018 addressed to the
appellant’s Assistant Director — Indirect Taxes, the respondent
requested to amend what it called ‘typing errors’ in the VAT
returns which it had submitted for November, 2017, February,
2018 and May, 2018. In response, the appellant informed the
respondent that a request to amend could not be entertained
once, as in this case, an audit was underway.

1.8 The audit thus proceeded in the absence of the amendment
sought by the respondent. It disclosed that some import VAT
claims made by the respondent in the periods November,
2017, February, 2018 and May, 2018 did not match with the
actual import documents furnished for purposes of
verification. Ultimately the VAT returns were found to have
been inaccurate along with the refund claims relating to them.

1.9 By letter dated 5th November, 2018, the respondent notified
the appellant that it accepted the result of the audit on
condition that the entries that had been disallowed on account

| of ‘typing errors’ be amended. That request was rejected on
J5
20th December, 2018 on grounds that the amendments to the
return could not be allowed in the midst of an audit.

1.10 The picture that emerged, as painted, at any rate by the
appellant, was as follows:
a

Month Refund K Adjustment amount
[vr wn |
il iil iil

1.11 Given the position as projected above, the appellant raised an
assessment on disallowed local purchases and imports. In
regard to local purchases, the appellant disallowed claims for
a provision of invoices, and merely for failure to qualify for VAT
refunds. For imports, claims were disallowed on the basis that
they were made on wrong bills of entry when compared with
the actual documents produced.

2.0 THE RESPONDENT COMPLAINS TO THE TRIBUNAL

2.1 The respondent was aggrieved by this turn of events and thus
launched a challenge before the Tribunal. It (as appellant
before the Tribunal) protested the disallowance by the
16
appellant of import VAT which was paid on entry numbers
C21263, C21274 and C21279 that were claimed in the May
VAT return.

2.2 In its notice before the Tribunal, filed on 13th September 2019,
the respondent grumbled that:

The Commissioner General erred in law and fact by disallowing
Import VAT paid on importation covered by Bill of Entries Nos.
C21274, C21263 and C21279 when VAT was duly paid and
claimed in May, 2018 VAT Return.

2.3 Before the Tribunal, the appellant (as respondent in those
proceedings), in its statement of case filed on 21st November,
2019, stoutly opposed the respondent’s appeal.

3.0 THE APPELLANT’S POSITION BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL

3.1 Before the Tribunal, the appellant opposed the appeal on the
ground that there was a mismatch between the actual import
documents furnished by the respondent and the CE20 entry
numbers which extended to wrong supplier and country of
origin details.

3.2 The appellant placed reliance on Rule 15(1) of Government
Gazette Notice No. 320 of 2014 made pursuant to section 18(3)
of the Customs and Excise Act, Chapter 233 of the Laws of
17
Zambia, which prescribes the nature of the documents
expected of an importer seeking to claim VAT credits or
refunds. According to the appellant, Entry Nos. CHR C.21274,
CHR C.21203 and CHR C.21279 could not be accepted for
import VAT refund claims as they showed different TPINS from
that of the respondent thus breaching Rule 15(1) of the Act.

4.0 THE TRIBUNAL HEARS THE APPEAL AND DECIDES

4.1 The Tribunal received evidence and representations on behalf
of the parties. The evidence before the Tribunal was that on
reviewing the prescribed documents presented to the appellant
the port code was ‘NKO’ and not ‘CHR’ which the respondent
had indicated in its appeal letter and further that the appellant
confirmed that the disallowed import VAT was paid by the
respondent. Additionally, the appellant did not, in verifying
the claim on appeal, refer to the source documents that were
verified by the Auditors.

4.2 It was also submitted that the TPIN and Assessment Notice
Numbers were not for the respondent but for other Taxpayers.
Counsel referred us to the record of appeal which show that
entries CHR C21274, CHR C21263 and CHR C21279 were
entries for Lumwana Mining, TPIN-1001828755, Kansanshi
18
Mining TPIN-1001602517 and Builders Warehouse
International (Z), TPIN-1002223300 respectively. The
respondent was registered as Match Corporation Limited and
later changed to Matalloy Company Limited, TPIN-
1001620992.

4.3 In a decision that has caused considerable consternation to
the appellant, the Tribunal ruled that the appellant’s approach
in treating the respondent’s application for VAT refunds was
fatally wrong.

4.4 The Tribunal reasoned that when dealing with any tax audit,
the appellant relies on the prescribed documents and in the
event of an appeal the same documents should be considered.
In this particular case, had the appellant based its decision on
the prescribed documents, which the respondent had earlier
presented, the import VAT would have been allowed in line
with the provisions of section 18 of the Value Added Tax Act.

4.5 In the view of the Tribunal, the appellant erred when it failed
to conclusively settle the case administratively by using the
prescribed documents as provided for in its own rules. The
appellant should have stuck to the same rules in reviewing
source documents as a basis for its decision in both cases of
J9
payment and refund of tax, adding that the appellant does not
have the option of dismissing the use of prescribed documents
to the disadvantage of taxpayers.

4.6 The Tribunal ultimately found that the appellant had allowed
certain entries that had errors which could readily be
identified on the ASYCUDA WORLD System. In the estimation
of the Tribunal, the three entries amounting to K131,015.00
were not allowed because the appellant’s method of
verification would not readily produce the matching result.

5.0 APPEAL TO THIS COURT

5.1 Unhappy with the decision of the Tribunal, the appellant filed
a notice of appeal. Three grounds were fronted couched as
follows:

1. That the Honourable Tribunal erred in law and in fact when
it ruled that the reason why the three entries in question
namely C21263, C21274 and C21279 were not allowed was
because the appellant’s method of verification could not
readily produce the matching result.

2. That the Honourable Tribunal erred in law and in fact when
it ruled that an error in designating port codes could be
verified through the actual prescribed documents and
ASYCUDA WORLD and should not be used to disadvantage
taxpayers who have duly paid import Value Added Tax.
J10
3. The Honourable Tribunal erred in law and in fact when it
ruled that the Commissioner General’s decision was reversed
and ordered the appellant to pay the respondent the Value
Added Tax withheld with interest from the time the
assessment was finalised.

5.2 The three grounds of appeal were supported by heads of
argument filed by counsel for the appellant. The respondent
opposed the appeal and purportedly filed heads of argument
in opposition. We shall revert to this point later in this
judgment.

5.3 At the hearing of the appeal, Ms. Kapamba on behalf of the
appellant, intimated that she was placing reliance on the
heads of argument.

6.0 THE APPELLANT’S CASE ON APPEAL

6.1 In regard to ground one of the appeal, the learned counsel for
the appellant submitted that the reason VAT refund claims
were disallowed on the three entries was because the said
entries did not meet the requirements of rule 15(1) of the VAT
Act (General) (Amendment) Rules, 2018 and, therefore, that
disallowance could not, contrary to the holding of the
Tribunal, be a wrongful act on the part of the respondent.
J11

6.2 The learned counsel submitted generally on the legal
provisions relating to VAT refunds and quoted quite
extensively from both the VAT Act and the Rules by way of
laying the background for their subsequent submissions.

6.3 More purposefully, the learned counsel submitted that in all
jurisdictions, including Zambia, claims for tax refunds or tax
credits are a sensitive and serious matter and any applications
for refunds or credits necessarily have to undergo severe and
rigorous scrutiny to ensure that only deserving applications
are allowed or sustained. Rules that set out such procedures
are designed to counter fraud upon the State and avert
fraudulent claims upon the revenue.

6.4 Counsel quoted approvingly from the Philippines case of
Filminera Resources Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal
Revenue(l) where the Court of Tax Appeals of that country
stated that:

In an action for refund, the burden of proof is on the taxpayer
to establish its right to refund, and failure to sustain the burden
is fatal to the claim for refund/credit.

6.5 The learned counsel for the appellant went on to quote the
following, somewhat long but perhaps relevant, passage from
the same case:
J12
There is no record of petitioner ever submitting complete
documents to substantiate its administrative claim for refund.
Such is a requirement, otherwise the administrative body will
have sufficient reasons to deny the claim. As held by the
Honourable Supreme Court in the case of Atlas Consolidated
Mining and Development Corporation v. Commissioner of
Inlands Revenue?, promulgated on March, 2007, the
Honourable Supreme Court held:
Petitioner’s contention that non-compliance with
Revenue Regulation 3-88 could not have adversely
affected its case in the CTA indicates a failure on its part
to appreciate the nature of the proceeding in that court.
First a judicial claim for refund or tax credit in the CTA is
by no means an original action but rather an appeal by
way of petition for review of a previous unsuccessful
administrative claim. Therefore, as in every appeal or
petition for review, a petitioner has to convince the
appellate court that quasi-judicial agency a quo did not
have reason to deny its claim. In this case, it is necessary
for petitioner to show the CTA not only that it was
entitled under substantive law to grant of its claim but,
also that it satisfied all the documentary evidence and
evidentiary requirements for administrative claim for
refund or tax credits.

6.6 The submission of counsel, in a nutshell, was that as the
respondent had not adduced proper documentation to the
appellant, it had failed to satisfy the requirements laid down
by Rule 15(1) of the VAT (General) (Amendment) Rules and
therefore, its claim for tax refund /credit was properly rejected.
Ji3

6.7 The learned counsel quoted further passages from the
Philippines case already referred to regarding, among other
things, the claimant for tax credit or refund bearing of the
burden of proof.

6.8 To emphasise the need for right documentation in tax credit
claims, counsel also adverted to a different case from the
Philippines, by way of analogy, namely Intel Technology
Philippines Inc v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue® where the
petitioner offered evidence to prove that it was engaged in
export sales during a particular period. That evidence
comprised export sales summaries, sales invoices, office
receipts, airway bills, export declarations and certification of
inward remittance during the period. That documentation was
accepted in that case as sufficient to enable the petitioner
sustain its claim for tax credit.

6.9 Rule 15(1) of the VAT Act (General) (Amendment) Rules 2018
which counsel quoted provides that:

For the purposes of subsection eighteen of the Act, the
prescribed documentary evidence for imported goods is a copy
of the ASYCUDA generated Customs and Excise Entry
Declaration (CE 20) which shall carry a TPIN and assessment
Notice Number at all times, and accompanied by the ASYCUDA
J14

generated receipt, evidencing the tax levied and paid on the

goods at importation.

6.10 Counsel equally quoted section 18(3) of the VAT Act which
reads as follows:

A supplier shall not deduct, credit, or claim input tax, unless

the supplier at the time of lodging the return in which the

deduction, credit or claim is made, is in possession of —-

(a) a tax invoice issued from a serially numbered invoice book
printed by a printer authorized for the purpose by the
Commissioner General,

(b) a tax invoice printed from a computer package authorized
by the Commissioner General for the purpose of invoicing
taxable suppliers; or in the case of imported goods, import
bills of entry or such documentary evidence of the
payment of tax as the Commissioner General may, by
administrative rule prescribe.

6.11 It was further posited that where the words on an Act of
Parliament are plain, as in the foregoing provisions, the court
will not make any alteration in them because injustice may be
occasioned. For this submission, counsel relied on our
decision in the case of Datson Siulapwa v. Failes Namasika®. In
support of the same submission counsel also quoted from the
case of Attorney General, Movement for Multiparty Democracy v.
Lewanika & Others(S).
J15

6.12 To buttress the point they were making, counsel added that,
as was held in Cape Brandy Syndicate v. Inland Commissioners(6),
the literal rule often animates the interpretation of fiscal
legislation.

6.13 The appellant’s learned counsel also referred to the Indian
Supreme Court judgment in SMT Tarulata Shyam wv.
Commissioner Income Tax? where the court observed that there
is no scope for importing into a statute words which are not
there.

6.14 They also quoted numerous other persuasive authorities from
outside this jurisdiction including the cases of Keshvji Ravji and
Company v. Commissioner Income Tax® and Anderson v.
Commissioner of Taxes, all dealing with interpretation of
statutes, to buttress the argument on construction of
legislation in general, and tax legislation in particular. The
point counsel reiterated was that under Rule 15(1) of the VAT
(General) (Amendment) Rules 2018, a taxpayer’s claim for
refund will only be successful if the TPIN, Notice of Assessment
Number and other details match those of the taxpayer
claiming the refund or credit, failing which the refund or credit
will be disallowed.
J16

6.15 There is, according to counsel, no ambiguity in Rule 15 of the
VAT (General) (Amendment) 2018 Rules so as to justify
invoking the principle that was articulated in Amalgamated
Society of Engineers v. Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd(19 that where
there is any ambiguity in constructing a tax statute the
ambiguity should be resolved in favour of the taxpayer.

6.16 In a manner reminiscent of circumlocution and repetition, the
learned counsel quoted various other case authorities in
support of the same proposition. To us, counsel was
belabouring a point they had already plainly made.

6.17 Counsel spent the remainder of their argument on ground one
distinguishing between a statutory provision which imports a
mandatory obligation and one which is merely directory. After
referring to the cases of Attorney General v. Million Juma! and
Mutantika & Sheal v. Kenneth Chipungu(!?, counsel submitted
that rule 15(1) is a mandatory rule as it uses the word ‘shall’.

6.18 In support of ground two of the appeal, the learned counsel
explained that the tax system is designed in such a manner
that taxpayers input and generate the tax liability. The
respondent in this case generated entries and ought to have
J17
known which ports of entry it used to import. In counsel’s
submission, an error in designating a port code is crucial
because the appellant has in its records entry numbers which
are the same but have different port codes.

6.19 In an effort to facilitate easy apprehension by this court of the
point they were laboring to articulate, the learned counsel
explained the relevant acronyms in this case as follows: NKO
(Nakonde), CHR (Chirundu) and KZU (Kazungula). The
respondent, according to the appellant, had port entry
numbers which were the same but had different port entry
codes. For example, NKO 526 could also be CHR 526.
According to the appellant, it can thus not give a tax refund
on a port entry that the tax-payer has not claimed as the tax-
payer may already have claimed on that entry and the
appellant may then have to refund them twice. It is thus, in
counsel’s view, significant for a taxpayer to be specific with
port entry codes.

6.20 Counsel explained that the port code on which the respondent
was claiming was ‘CHR’. Some of the entries it claimed VAT
refunds on matched the details and the VAT refund claims
were allowed accordingly. However, the three entries which
J18
were disallowed did not match the respondent’s details such
as its TPIN, Assessment Notice numbers and details of the
respondent as the details furnished belonged to different tax-
payers altogether.

6.21 In buttressing the submission counsel were making on the
need for specificity, they adverted to the case of Cape Brandy
Syndicate v. Inland Commissioners® and quoted the following
passage:

In a taxing Act, one has to look merely at what is said. There is
no room for intendment. There is no equity about tax. There is
no presumption as to a tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is
to be implied. One can only look fairly at the language used.

6.22 Turning to the respondent’s position, counsel submitted that
the respondent had asked for a refund under ‘NKO’ as is
evident from its notice of appeal when it is clear that the entry
numbers on which it was claiming VAT refund claims are
‘CHR’ and not ‘NKO’. Even then the respondent had put ‘CHA’
rather than ‘CHR’.

6.23 It was also submitted that after the audit the respondent wrote
to the appellant to amend some ports of entry from ‘CHA’ to
‘CHR’. As ‘CHA’ does not exist, the appellant gracefully
understood the typo. This, however, did not put the
J19
respondent’s grief to rest. The port entry NKO which was being
referred to by the respondent at trial was never mentioned at
any time by the respondent as it requested to amend the
returns. To thus expect a refund on NKO for a CHR entry is,
in counsel’s submission, rather irrational.

6.24 Counsel referred us to Rule 14(1) of the VAT Rules, 2018 which
deals with correction of errors on over-declaration and under
declaration. They submitted that as the respondent itself had
argued, there was no over-declaration or under-declaration to
enable it amend its return.

6.25 It was the appellant’s further submission that what was at
issue in this appeal was not the audit report; rather it was the
disallowance of the VAT refund claims on the grounds already
alluded to.

6.26 As regards the final ground of appeal, namely that the Tribunal
erred when it ruled that the Commissioner General’s decision
was reversed, counsel submitted that the decision of the
Commissioner General was in all respects sound as the entries
disallowed carried not the TPIN number of the respondent but
of other parties, nor were the entry numbers correct and in
compliance with Rule 15(1).
120

6.27 Counsel submitted that the respondent failed to demonstrate
that the Commissioner General erred in law when he
disallowed the VAT refund claims on the entry numbers
concerned which, as was demonstrated, were non-conforming
with the provisions of Rule 15(1). He cited the case of Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines Investment Holdings Plc v. Woodgate
Holdings Ltd.(13 where the court held that:

Where a plaintiff makes allegations, it is generally for him to
prove those allegations. A plaintiff who fails to prove his case
cannot be entitled to judgment. The evidence adduced must
establish the issue raised to a fairly high degree of convincing
clarity.

6.28 In the present case, counsel submitted that the respondent
failed to adduce evidence to establish its claims. They thus
implored us to uphold all the grounds of appeal.

7.0 THE RESPONDENT’S CASE ON APPEAL

7.1 The respondent had strenuously purported to oppose the
appeal and support the holding of the Tribunal in its entirety.
This was in the heads of argument in opposition which were
apparently signed by Matalloy Company Limited with its
mobile phone number thereon indicated.
. 21

7.2 At the hearing of the appeal, a Mr. Bruno Musunga rose to his
feet and sought to address us from the public gallery where he
had been sitting all the while since the case was called. He
introduced himself as a Tax Consultant and in the appeal, a
representative of the respondent company. He also confirmed
having authored the heads of argument on behalf of the
respondent company.

7.3 We at once urged him to assume his seat, making it
abundantly clear that we had no appetite to entertain his
brave attempt for he, as an unqualified person, to represent
an incorporated company in legal proceedings. The reason for
our reaction is that unlike litigants in person, we do not readily
countenance non-advocate representation of corporate
entities.

7.4 Lay persons are unqualified to practice before the courts. The
rule which bars them from practicing before the courts has
been consistently applied for years and is not based on
technicalities. The exception is, of course, the case of litigants
in person.

7.5 To be clear, the rule that a company cannot conduct a case
before our courts except by the appearance of an admitted
. 122
advocate is not based on any misguided attempt to preserve
an unjustified monopoly for legal practitioners. The position
is lucid. That rule exists and is observed for programmatic
and sound policy reasons.

7.6 It has long been based on considerations central to the proper
administration of justice and the protection of the parties to
litigation. As was stressed in Meek v. Fleming¥, the
administration of justice requires that those permitted to
appear before the courts owe a responsibility to the court to
ensure that the court is properly informed, not misled.

7.7 In the case of Worldwide Enterprises Pty Ltd v. Silberman(*® the
Victorian Court of Appeal stated, among other things, that:

Where a lay person appears on behalf of a company, the court is
deprived of the assistance it might otherwise receive, and to
which it might be thought to be entitled. Also, a lay advocate is
not subject to the ethical precepts that apply to legal
practitioners who are entitled to address the court, but who
bring with them particular responsibilities when doing so.

7.8 We cannot stress enough the significance of having, as a
representative of a company before court proceeding, a person
who is not only responsible to the instructing party in the
litigation, but to the court as well, being an officer of the court.
. 123

7.9 The New South Wales Supreme Court of Appeal in the recent
decision in Tanamerah Estates Pty Ltd v. Tibra Capital Pty Ltd(16
reminds corporations once again that in almost all cases they
must be legally represented in court proceedings.

7.10 In Workers’ Development Corporation (ZCTU) Ltd v. Davy
Mkandawire1”), we confirmed the legal position that a body
corporate must be represented in civil litigation by an advocate
unless leave has been previously obtained from the court, in
the exercise of its inherent power to regulate its own
proceeding, to be represented by a director or other senior
person.

7.11 As stated in the Davy Mkandawire(1?) case, we are prepared to
accept that there could be a relaxation of the rule in
appropriate circumstances. A superior court is entitled in
terms of its inherent jurisdiction to grant such relaxation
where doing so would best serve the administration of justice,
though such permission would be rarely granted and the
circumstances would have to be exceptional or at least
unusual.
: 124

7.12 In this particular case, there has been no permission sought
for the respondent as a corporate body to be represented by a
lay person who is otherwise qualified as a tax expert. The urge
for us to assess whether this is a proper case to consider a
relaxation of the rule against lay representation of corporate
bodies, did not even arise.

7.13 It was for the reasons we have articulated in the foregoing
paragraphs that we formed the view that the respondent’s
heads of argument, drafted as they were, by an unqualified
person, are liable to be discountenanced.

7.14 Having jettisoned the respondent’s heads of argument we
made it clear to counsel for the appellant, that even in the
absence of legal representation on the part of the respondent
and in the absence also of opposing arguments, the fate of the
appeal was not fait a compli. The appeal would still be subject
to the same judicious considerations as any other.

7.15 The settled position of the law, which we articulated in Khalid
Mohamed v. Attorney Generall®), namely that a plaintiff cannot
automatically succeed where a defence failed, but is obliged to
prove his case, applies mutatis mutandis to appeals before this
court. There can be no automatic success of an appeal merely
.

. J25
because a response has collapsed or the respondent, for any
other reason, fails to put up a credible opposition to the
appeal.

7.16 An additional reason for us to scrutinize unopposed appeals
is that in our role of providing judicial oversight over lower
courts by way of correcting errors and misdirections, we are
obliged to review the evidence on record and to assess whether
the allegations of error or misdirection on the part of the lower
court (or Tribunal) are indeed justifiable. In this way, our
appellate role serves wider interests than those of the parties
to the appeal.

8.0 OUR ANALYSIS AND DECISION

8.1 We have paid the closest attention to the submissions of the
appellant’s learned counsel. We have also perused with
interest the documents on the record of appeal.

8.2 Our view is that the overarching issue for consideration in this
appeal is, as intimated at the opening paragraph of this
judgment, whether the appellant was justified to reject the
respondent’s claim for VAT refund on the basis that the
documentation produced to support the application for a
refund were wanting in some respects. With this projection of
.

. 126
the question determinative of the appeal, we shall deal with
the three grounds of appeal globally.

8.3 The factual background is really not controverted. The
respondent does not deny that there were errors in the
documentation that it had submitted to support the VAT
refund. The position the respondent takes which we, at any
rate, gather from the documentation laid before the Tribunal
by the respondent itself was that the import bills of entry
which it submitted could easily be matched with the
documents produced by the respondent for audit and
verification of payment of taxes.

8.4 The respondent’s position is that the appellant’s officer, who
conducted the physical audit, was furnished with import
documents which were verified. Therefore, by not restricting
its audit findings to the documents provided and going beyond
those documents to find fault to justify disallowance of the VAT
refunds, the appellant’s action constituted palpable and
overriding errors which severely prejudiced the respondent’s
position.

8.5 The Tribunal agreed with the respondent when it held that:

The respondent [now appellant] has further admitted that in
verifying the claims on appeal, they did not refer to the source
documents that were verified by the auditors as prescribed in
the Commissioner’s Administrative Rule (15) but relied on the
appellant’s letter....
We find that the respondent erred when it failed to conclusively
settle this case administratively by failing to use the prescribed
documents as provided for in its own rules. The respondent
must abide by the same rules in reviewing source documents as
a basis of decision in both cases of payment of refund of tax....

8.6 We have already comprehensively captured the arguments
advanced by the appellant to support its position that the
finding of the Tribunal was steeped in appealable error.

8.7 We must admit that for an importer entitled to VAT refund, it
must be a bewildering and frustrating experience to be
disallowed VAT refunds particularly when it is not disputed
that VAT was paid on the imports.

8.8 The position of the appellant, namely that there was no
compliance with rule 15 of the VAT Act General Rules for the
refund to be sanctioned must be understood within the
general framework of the law designed to curb fraud on the
fiscus. The payment of tax refunds no doubt creates lucrative
opportunities for fraud and corruption.

8.9 There is no question whatsoever that rule 15(1) of the VAT Act
(General) (Amendment) Rules 2018 as we have reproduced it
at paragraph 6.9 prescribes not only the documents that ought
to be produced on claiming VAT refunds on imported goods,
but what those documents should contain.

8.10 As the position now stands, there is no argument impeaching
" either the vires or the efficacy of the rules made pursuant to
: section 18(3) of the VAT Act. Taking the submission of the

appellant’s learned counsel pro veritate, the respondent was
. obliged to comply with the law as set out in rule 15(1) of the

VAT (General) (Amendment) Rules.

8.11 We accept the submissions by counsel for the appellant that
in any action for refund, the burden of proof is squarely on the
taxpayer to establish its right to a refund. In this connection,
the Philippines Tax Appeals Case of Filminera Resources
Corporation v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue(! which they
cited, is within the ambit of the position we take.

8.12 What is known as the burden of proof in tax matters is in fact
the responsibility to prove entries, deductions, statements and
payments made on a taxpayer’s returns. A taxpayer must be
‘ J29
able to demonstrate or substantiate the elements necessary
for either deduction or credit by providing accurate
information and all details needed. Under VAT, as with other
taxes, this compliance burden is facilitated by proper record
keeping by the taxpayer.

8.13 Our view is that rule 15(1) is not onerous in its requirements.
It stems fraudulent VAT refunds, and this presents a fair and
reasonable tradeoff between minimizing the taxpayer’s
compliance burden and minimizing the risk of issuing
fraudulent VAT refunds which we have earlier alluded to.

8.14 That the respondent produced wrong documentation bearing
wrong TPIN numbers is not in dispute. By so doing the
respondent was literally the author of its own misfortune.

8.15 Our considered view is therefore that, taken in the round, the
appellant was legally justified to disallow the VAT claim based
on wrong documentation. The Tribunal was, accordingly,
wrong to hold as it did. The appellant bore no duty to make a
valid case for VAT refund for the respondent which was unable
to produce prescribed documents and details. The appeal
thus succeeds in its entirety.
